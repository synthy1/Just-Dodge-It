## Overview

Halftone is a technique used in printing where you layer a small number of differently-coloured inks on top of each other, in a pattern of variable-size dots, to form new colours. A similar type of dot pattern is sometimes used as an element of the Pop Art style, where just one layer of coloured dots appears to form a shading gradient on a surface. 

This repository contains a shader that calculates the diffuse lighting on an object and automatically converts those values into darkened dots at each point on the object.
